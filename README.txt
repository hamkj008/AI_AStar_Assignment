This project uses the A* pathing heuristic to solve a grid maze.

This project won't run like a normal project. Instead, there are specific pytest tests that the project has to pass to be considered successful. 
To run the tests use either:
1. Run the test explorer in Visual Studio to see the output and status of the tests.
2. Run the pytest command in the terminal from the project directory.
3. Run the specific tests and maps from the terminal. for example: python pathfinding_task1.py 3,2 0,3 resources/terrain01.txt 50
